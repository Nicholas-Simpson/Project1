Song Popularity on Spotify and Youtube  
Group 3: Mirtha, Haley, Nicolas and Edward  

Project Overview  
We were contacted by two large streaming services, Spotify and Youtube, to find out what makes a song popular on their platforms. We looked at the type of album the song was part of, if it was licensed, the danceability and loudness of a song. We plotted these variables with the number of streams and views to determine if there was a significant correlation between these variables and the successfulness of the song on these platforms.  

Methods  
We divided our data into two categories, numerical data and categorical data. Some of the methods used to analyze our data included defined funcitions to create plots, isolated numerical values, created scatter plots for each variable, created functions for multiple use, used Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and grouby functions.

Analysis  
For our project we decided to investigate the following questions:  
  Can the same artist do well on both platforms?  
  Does album type affect song popularity on both platforms?  
  Do licensed songs have an effect on the popularity?  
  Does a song with high danceability make it more popular?  
  Do louder songs perform better on both platforms?  
  
Our analysis concludes that songs with the highest streams and views are part of an album and not singles. There was a significant difference between how many streams/views a song gets based if it was part of an album or not. This finding was also shown with the songs that are licensed. Songs that are licensed have higher views/streams than those songs that aren't. 

It is evidently seen that songs that are louder perform better. The levels of loudness are measured in decibels and are averaged throughout the entire track. As seen for streams, there are more songs that have a higher decibel and are more popular. Through further investigation, Spotify has a higher audio streaming quality allowing us to understand the correlation between loudness and streams and views.

As for the comparison between danceability and popularity of songs, a track that is more danceable makes it more prone to being more successful. The danceability is found through measures of tempo, rhythym stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. 0.0 being least danceable and 1.0 being the most danceable. The scatterplot created goes to show that songs with a higher danceability rate see more views and streams.

We also compared whether the same artist can do well on both platforms. Based on our analysis, most artists are not able to succeed in both streams on Spotify and views on Youtube. We decided to display the top 10 artists and only two out of the ten were able to do well on both platforms. 

Limitations  
The data set used was heavily dependent on the time that was collected. All data was collected on Feb 27, 2023. This limited us to only knowing what song/artists were popular on that specific day.  
Only 10 songs for each artist were collected for the data set we used.   
We were only limmited to only the variables shown on the data set.
