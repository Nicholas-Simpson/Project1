# Project1
Song Popularity on Spotify and Youtube  
Group 3: Mirtha, Haley, Nicolas and Edward  

Project Overview  
We were contacted by two large streaming services, Spotify and Youtube, to find out what makes a song/artist popular on their platforms. We looked at the type of album the song was part of, if it was licensed, the danceability
and loudness of a song. We plotted these variables with the number of streams and views to determine if there was a significant correlation between these variables and successfulness of the song on these platforms.  

Methods  
We divided our data into two categories, numerical data and categorical data. Some of the methods used to anylyze our data included defined funcitions to create plots, isolated numerical values, created scatter plots for each variable, created functions for multiple use, used Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and grouby functions.

Analysis  
For our project we decided to investigate the following questions that would help us determine what characteristics make a song popular on Spotify
